* anjel

A Clojure client for the [[https://angel.co/api][AngelList API]]

** Usage

Add to your project.clj:

=[anjel "0.0.1"]=

Then:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure

    (require '[anjel.core :as anjel])

    (anjel/find-startup "a startup")
#+END_SRC

Return will be =nil= if no matches are found, or a hash of the
attributes of the first matching startup.

Honestly, I wouldn't use this in production yet. Work in progress.
